# Placement Management System (PMS)

The **Placement Management System (PMS)** is a web-based application developed as a **Final Year Minor Project (B.Tech CSE)**.

It is designed to act as a **job-portal–style platform** that connects students and recruiters through a centralized placement system.

The project focuses on simplifying job postings, applications, and placement tracking for both candidates and recruiters.

## 📌 Project Overview

PMS provides two primary user roles:

- **Candidate**

  - Browse available job listings
  - Apply for jobs
  - Track application status
  - Manage profile and resume

- **Recruiter**
  - Post job openings
  - View and manage applications
  - Update candidate application status

The system aims to reduce manual placement processes and provide a structured, role-based workflow for campus placements.
